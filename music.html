                I mainly sing but I also play the piano and the guitar.

                ðŸŽ¤ I enjoy singing Chinese / Japanese pop songs the most, and I am currently taking voice lessons to sing better. 
                I made a lot of friends from making covers and I also learned cool skills such as audio engineering and video editing!
                Here is one of my favourite covers:

                ðŸŽ¹ I started playing the piano when I was four, and I learned a lot of classical pieces. Although I haven't been playing
                 as much, it would be cool to get back into it! My favourite piece to play is Arabesque No. 1 by Debussy.

                ðŸŽ¸ I started playing the acoustic guitar in Grade 8 under the influence of Japanese fingerstyle. One of my favourite 
                artist is Masaaki Kishibe, here are three pieces that I covered for an independent study unit project for Grade 12 music
                 class! I hope you liked it as much as my music teacher did :D
